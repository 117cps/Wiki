### Contributing

The Valor Wiki is open to contributions from all members of the Valor Community.

### Local Development

You should start off by cloning the project and having node 16+ installed.

$ cd valor-wiki
$ npm install
$ npm run 
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
