# Refund Policy

## Our Commitment to Players
We strive to provide the best possible gaming experience and offer our refund system as a courtesy to support players who encounter genuine technical issues or server-related problems. While we carefully review each request, please understand that refunds are provided at our discretion to ensure fair play and server stability.

## General Guidelines
- Active refund tickets must not be discussed publicly. Sharing refundable clips before a ticket is concluded may result in automatic denial.
- Each refund request is reviewed individually. References to other tickets or circumstances will not be considered.
- The final decision on all refunds lies with the moderation team.
- In exceptional circumstances, cases that fall outside these guidelines may be reviewed by multiple moderators for special consideration. However, this is extremely rare and should not be expected.

## Proof Requirements
1. **Recording Requirements**
   - First-person recordings are strongly preferred and will expedite the review process
   - Recordings with keyboard/input overlays are highly recommended for all submissions
   - Third-person recordings may be accepted at staff discretion
   - No proof = no refund (except for documented server-wide issues)
   - For nexus input issues, an input overlay is mandatory - audio proof alone is insufficient

2. **Quality of Proof**
   - Proof must be clear and unambiguous
   - Unclear or ambiguous proof may result in denial
   - Edited or manipulated footage will result in permanent account/Discord bans

## What We Refund

### Server-Related Issues
- Frame skipping due to high-stress instances
- Server crashes and rollbacks (specific instances only)

### Bug-Related Deaths
- The bug must be the direct cause of death
- Examples of non-refundable scenarios:
  - Core activation deaths when nexus time was available
  - Deaths following a stacked shot but occurring normally afterward

- Dragging deaths
- AFK or tabbed-out deaths
- Deaths from intentionally sitting on/near dangerous mobs
- Item lending incidents
- Hacked accounts older than 4 months
- Deaths without first-person recording
- Fabricated or misrepresented scenarios

## Trial Refunds
- Refunded via quake with original party members when possible
- Trial tokens may be provided if party reconstitution isn't possible
- Some situations may be deemed non-refundable at moderator discretion

## Time Limits
- Death-related refunds: Within 5 days
- Item-related refunds: Within 2 weeks

## Miscellaneous Rules
- Harassment of moderators will result in punishment
- Lies or misleading statements result in permanent bans
- Creating alternate accounts to avoid punishment is forbidden
