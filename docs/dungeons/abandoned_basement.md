### Boss Behaviours
The Boss will cycle between all 5 phases until dead.

Phase 1: The boss will rapidly fire a tight shotgun of 3 low-damaging blue shots at the player. If you are on a character on low defense, these could easily mow your HP down. The Boss will also fire a wide shotgun of white armor-piercing bullets that inflict confused on the player. If you get hit by these while dodging the blue shots, it's best to back off until it wears off. 

Phase 2: The boss will move erratically, firing low-damaging red projectiles in a ring around him. The boss will also fire wide shotguns of white confuse shots at the player, and also lob grenades at the player. 

Phase 3: He will move side to side, shooting white confuse at the player, while spraying the low-damage blue shots all around him. After a few seconds of this phase,  
the boss will cry "I need more power!" and begin moving towards where he spawned. 

Phase 4: Turrets from either side of the room will begin firing across the room. Each shot will deal 120 armor-piercing damage, so avoid these at the risk of your health being quickly whittled down.

Phase 5: The boss will start spawn two minions (that fire shotguns of pink confuse shots), then begin white confuse shots around him, followed by tight shotguns of dark-blue blasts dealing a whopping 200 damage per shot. While doing this, the boss will also spawn blue orbs around the room, that shoot paralyzing shots in a cross-shaped pattern. It's best to stay back until this phase is over, or until the boss cycles back to phase 1.


# Tips & Tricks:
1. Aspect of baast would make much of the fight a cakewalk by negating the debuffs.

2. You can wait out phase 5. The boss will cycle back to phase 1 after a short period of time, although you will still have to clear the stacked minions.  

3. Never forget you can call the dungeon for a more experienced player to help you out with it.

4. Do not try to rush the dungeon if your character lacks defense. You will get shredded like shredded cheese by the minions.
