# Abandoned Basement

![map](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/953134990428868629/991559620097224835/map.png)

The Abandoned Basement drops from **Sorgigas, the Sor Giant's Sor Crystals** in the Realm. Within the dungeon there are powerful enemies, so make sure to rush with caution and always clear if you do not feel confident. There are 3 Treasure Rooms--indicated by the boxes on the map--which do not attack but are surrounded by enemies--and only one boss, the Dark Sorcerer.

# The Dark Sorcerer

## Phases

Phase 1: The boss will rapidly fire a tight shotgun of 3 low-damaging blue shots at the player. If you are on a character on low defense, these could easily mow your HP down. The Boss will also fire a wide shotgun of white armor-piercing bullets that inflict confused on the player. If you get hit by these while dodging the blue shots, it's best to back off until it wears off.

Phase 2: The boss will move erratically, firing low-damaging red projectiles in a ring around him. The boss will also fire wide shotguns of white confuse shots at the player, and also lob grenades at the player.

Phase 3: He will move side to side, shooting white confuse at the player, while spraying the low-damage blue shots all around him. After a few seconds of this phase,
the boss will cry "I need more power!" and begin moving towards where he spawned.

Phase 4: Turrets from either side of the room will begin firing across the room. Each shot will deal 120 armor-piercing damage, so avoid these at the risk of your health being quickly whittled down.

Phase 5: The boss will start spawn two minions (that fire shotguns of pink confuse shots), then begin white confuse shots around him, followed by tight shotguns of dark-blue blasts dealing a whopping 200 damage per shot. While doing this, the boss will also spawn blue orbs around the room, that shoot paralyzing shots in a cross-shaped pattern. It's best to stay back until this phase is over, or until the boss cycles back to phase 1.

## Tips

Aspect of Baast could help deal with the confusion that the boss applies throughout the fight.

Come with a maxed character, this dungeon is dangerous for low defense/hp characters.

Avoid rushing unless confident--if you feel something could go wrong, it might.

## Item Drops

**The Treasure Room and Boss drop the same loot, with the exception of the [Aspect of Vamps](https://wiki.valorserver.com/docs/items/misc/aspects), which only drops from the Boss.**
