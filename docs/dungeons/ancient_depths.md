# Ancient Depths

![Layout](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/953134990428868629/1027327917031690271/unknown.png)

The Ancient Depths is an event dungeon dropping from **Yazanahar** in the Realm. This is a pretty difficult dungeon that is definitely best completed with a large group with good DPS. Doing this dungeon in small groups can be very slow as well as difficult, so if you do decide to do so make sure to bring allies with Warrior, Paladin, Templar, Mystic and other such buffing/debuffing characters. The dungeon is very short literal length as it is only 3 rooms with one being your spawn, however that does not make it any less threatening.

# Krokinach

The first boss of the Ancient Depths, Krokanich, is a big threat to any character. It is best to keep your distance from the boss as it's primary damage is shotgun shots. The minions summoned by the boss are best to be killed as they can apply bleeding. The hardest hitting attack is the wavy shots he shoots in a 90 degree cone, he will shoot out 4 grey shots and 4 green shots. The grey shots deal around 200 damage and inflicts armor broken on the player. The green shots deal around 200 damage that inflicts bleeding on the player. This boss has a rage phase when it grows low on health, becareful and avoid his jumps.

## Tips

1. Play especially cautious on Melee classes, due to the high damage shotguns.

2. There is a delay between the grey/green shotgun so you can use this to go in and attack the boss when his shots are lower damage.

3. Rage phase will jump often so it is recommended to only go in and attack him close range when he has just jumped and shot the grey/green shotgun.

# Xanarich, the Chosen One

The second boss of the Ancient Depths, Xanarich, is similarly a major threat, as even near-complete characters can manage to somehow die during this boss fight. The boss will begin the boss invulnerable and summon minions, it is the best call if you clear these minions immediately as they can seriously damage you, and potentially even just outright instakill. Keep your distance from the boss following the spawn of the minions however, as he will begin slowly shuffling toward the nearest player, unleashing shotguns that can easily kill.

## Tips 

1. This is another difficult boss fight for Melee classes, play with caution.

2. During the minion phase, you can drag Xanarich into Krokinach's boss room.

3. You do not need to kill the minions to kill the boss.
