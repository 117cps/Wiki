The Catacombs is an event dungeon dropping from **Zaragon, the Blood Mage** in the Realm, however it can additionally be purchased in the Guild hall. This dungeon is is incredibly large, simalar to the size of the Elemental Ruins. This is THE dungeon for fame farming--assuming you have good damage with enemy pierce or a group. You can get upwards of 10,000 Base Fame per full clear. Enemies within the Catacombs pose a major threat to even high defense players, so be sure to clear carefully and with patience.

In the **Destroy Key** section, you will--as the name suggests--need to clear keys. These small spider-like keys can be found within the rooms of the Destroy Keys box on the map, and the door leading to Boss 2 and 3 can only be accessed once they are all destroyed.

## Phases

Phase 1: The boss sits in place, firing confusion stars and a straight shotgun, this shotgun does not deal a debuff.

Phase 2: The boss begins to shuffle around, firing blue shots in a shotgun stlye which paralyze the player for a hefty period of time.

Phase 3: The boss will stop moving and flash red, and begin to fire radial red stars.

## Tips

<ul>

<li>This boss is completely optional, so if you struggle, do not feel too bad, there are 2 others!</li>

<li>Avoid the Paralyzing shots during Phase 2, as they can be scary, especially if armor broken by a nearby minion.</li>

<li>Clear all minions to prevent any armor breaking from happening!</li>

## Phases 

**The boss will heal throughout the boss-fight.**

Phase 1: The boss will chase the nearest player, firing a loose fire shotgun, these shots blind. 

Phase 2: The boss will slowly spew flames toward the nearest player. 

Phase 3: The boss will fire a white shotgun and then shuffle away for a few seconds, then will fire a radial shot along with a shotgun.

Phase 4: The boss will chase the nearest player, looking to sit on them with an EP-Style shot, as well as throwing bombs.

## Tips

<ul>

<li>This boss is optional, so if you struggle, do not feel too bad, there is still the main boss of the Catacombs!</li>

<li>Keep your distance from the boss, as it has very high damage shots, so do not get cocky and try to tank it!</li>
