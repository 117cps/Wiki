The Concealment of the Dreadnought is a mid-game dungeon, dropping from the **Construct of Concealment** in the Godlands. The Construct of Concealment has a chance to spawn upon killing a Construct God. Within the dungeon there are 6 Treasure Rooms, which are easier to defeat than the boss. The enemies in the dungeon can be very problematic, so I'd only recommend rushing if you are confident with the pathing of the dungeon, as players can easily take a wrong turn and get caught in a deadend.

## Phases

Phase 1: The Dreadnought will shuffle in place, firing a radial shot as well as one straight shot at the nearest target; the boss will fire 3 bursts; then begin to rely on shotguns.
w
Phase 2: He will rotate in a circle, firing a radial boomerang shot while also launching a shotgun at the nearest target; as well as an additional normal radial shot.

Phase 3: The boss will begin to hunt the nearest player, attempting to sit on them with a plethera of shots.

Phase 4: The boss will begin to regenerate HP, launching fast radial shots to force players to keep their distance.

Phase 5: The boss will shuffle left and right, launching a volley of circular black shots. These shots will absolutely rip any character to shreds.

Phase 6: The boss will unload almost all of his shot types toward the nearest player, including the circular-black shots, radial shots and now bombs. After this phase the boss will return to Phase 1.

## Tips

<ul>
<li>Avoid fighting this boss on Melee at all costs, his shots to incredible damage that can easily destroy almost any character</li>

<li>The Treasure Rooms are significantly easier than the boss, and while you lose out on some of the boss' signature loot; it is never worth a character slot for an item</li>
</ul>

Phase 2: The boss will remain stationairy, firing shotgun waves at the nearest target.

## Tips

<ul>

</ul>
