## 1ST PHASE
There's only 2 intermission needed to activate hardmode which is making him fall twice before dealing with mini's or instakilling them
 
At 1st phase he will summon all the mini's dps and will have ar spell air in their party spellbomb before insta killing or pushing them back to 2nd phase to follow up hardmode.

PROGRESS
Everyone should be letting in the mini’s teleport to the group to get stunned from the tori’s make sure to spawn it after they’ve spawned next to it. Do not panic as this will draw attention to all mini’s and will get stunned in the process except plant weaver he will decide where to teleport and attack as he isn’t very threatful careful with wizard/plant weaver purple shots as the can quiet your party for 10 seconds or less.
 
 
## 2ND PHASE
After he's pushed to 2nd phase he will corrupt the mini's giving them an upgrade 2nd phase requires to hurt phalgomor until he has been fallen.
 

The Dps will spellbomb/push him again and then back to focus on pushing them back to 3rd phase or just insta kill them.
 

 
Once they're dealt with he can push to 3rd phase.
 
 
 

## 3RD PHASE

DPS or anyone should not damage him as he will always be shooting regardless as for this is not needed.
 
**After pushing him to 3rd phase all the remaining mini's will become voided requiring you to kill the leftovers.**
 
**Since phalgomor voided all the mini’s they all will become more feral except the wizard he will always be rotating and shooting magic.**
 
**Remember to always drag the mini’s to torri. It's your best shot to push every single of their phases to voided phase or instantly kill them with the chance of burst dps.**
 
There's a special phase for the wizard he will spawn 3 different sigils that are required to kill before killing them. you have to kill the remaining mini’s to finish the wizard's sigil and itself, the other 3x minions don't require anything but to kill them. 
but they're like a lock, so you can kill the wizard and the fight ends.

 # Deathdream
    
This dungeon is now the party vs him now we've pissed him off
 
Enough to possibly ruin our career's
 
The boss fight starts when there's a red dot in the map and to activate boss there an tile activation to the bottom right go there to being the fight
 
 
He will appear second by second. You can decide to deal early damage after once his eyes glow because he can be also damaged for a split second or window frame in the beginning.
 
**Once his eyes glow BACK UP FAST AS YOU CAN**

 
A stun maiden can place a weak torri to prevent the painful impact he will cause.
YOU need to be quick before anything else and back out, also look at your mini map for maneuvering red dots as they are in fact pink orbs.  

Once he finish doing that you'll have to find 3 different types of shades throughout the map
they appear from inner, middle outer, and then outer they will spawn glowing they don’t do anything but rotate slowly 

**DON’T INSTA THE LAST SHADE THAT IS OUTER IT WILL BREAK THE BOSS AND THE FIGHT WON’T END AT ALL.**
 

Phalgomor will also spawn 2 orbs at the furthest player possible during the fight.
 
Once you've manage to kill all 3 shades you can now properly attack phalgomor until the group has dealt 10% of his hp and the fight ends.
 
Be aware of phalgomor chase attacks you might need to slow him or use a speedy sprout at all cost.

It’s best for ranged classes to take him down or an vinelocker knight.
 
Orbs and phalgomor can be slowed to make things easier as well.
 
Also when he turns on the lights it is over, finally swap out to your fortune gear and dodge the remaining projectiles .
 
 
![arena]()
 
This arena is safe to walk on just never touch the purple phalgomor force field.
 
Other than that the map will become pitch dark black and phalgomor will thank you for defeating him.
