## Storm Palace

![themap](https://i.imgur.com/p7qObjm.png)

The Storm Palace is a mid-tier dungeon, dropping from the **Thunder God** in the Godlands. It can be easily steam rolled with low amounts of players but can also be challenging to those who cannot kill the boss immediately.

If you choose to rush the Storm Palace, keep your eyes out for this enemy type. This enemy will paralyze you and, depending on what room your in and where in that room you are, could be a very very bad outting for your character.

## Phases

Phase 1: The boss will shoot out a few paralyze shots in all directions. These shots will do around 150 damage and can permanently paralyze you if the boss is still targeting you.

Phase 2: He will shoot out 3 slow shots in 4 directions, these shots are close together forcing you into certain areas. This phase is an easy damage phase if you look out for the occasional stun shots he shoots out.

Phase 3: The boss will begin to heal, spawning in 2 minions that will follow you and paralyze you. A few seconds after these minions spawn the boss loops back into the first phase.

## Tips

<ul>
<li>Stay away from the boss as its activating, as it will fire a paralyzing shot at the nearest player</li>

<li>The boss will not attack if you are far enough away or invisible, so come with range or invis for the best chance</li>

<li>Do the second boss first, and then do this boss</li>
</ul>

## Phases 

Phase 1: He will be armored and stay stationary, unleashing several rounds of very low-damage projectiles and grenades all around him. After a fixed amount of time, he will switch to phase 2. This phase is only ever challenging for extremely early-game players, with extremely low defense or dps.

Phase 2: He will emerge from his crystal form and begin firing a singular shot towards the player that deals very low damage, alongside blasts of paralyzing and darkness-inducing shots (with a very long delay between blasts). This phase is extremely easy as a singular player can just stand still and avoid all the paralyzing and darkness shots.
