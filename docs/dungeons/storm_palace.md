### Boss Behaviours
Phase 1: The boss will shoot out a few paralyze shots in all directions. These shots will do around 150 damage and can permanently paralyze you if the boss is still targeting you.

Phase 2: He will shoot out 3 slow shots in 4 directions, these shots are close together forcing you into certain areas. This phase is an easy damage phase if you look out for the occasional stun shots he shoots out.

If you still haven't kill the boss by this point he will heal then spawn in 2 minions that will follow you and paralyze you. A few seconds after these minions spawn the boss loops back into the first phase.

## Secret Boss: Construct of the Storm (phase 1)

Phase 1: He will be armored and stay stationary, unleashing several rounds of very low-damage projectiles and grenades all around him. After a fixed amount of time, he will switch to phase 2. This phase is only ever challenging for extremely early-game players, with extremely low defense or dps.

## Secret Boss: Construct of the Storm (phase 2)

Phase 2: He will emerge from his crystal form and begin firing a singular shot towards the player that deals very low damage, alongside blasts of paralyzing and darkness-inducing shots (with a very long delay between blasts). This phase is extremely easy as a singular player can just stand still and avoid all the paralyzing and darkness shots. 

# Tips & Tricks:

1. Stand back from the first boss when it's activating so you dont get hit by the first paralyze shot and get permanently paralyzed.

2. You always have the option to call the dungeon and let a more experienced/better geared player to rush it for you.

3. Always assume that bright yellow shots will paralyze you. Dodge these at any cost, or you may be permanently paralyzed and forced to nexus. 

4. Rushing the dungeon is actually harder than doing the troom boss, due to the minions which deal a ton more damage than the boss itself.
