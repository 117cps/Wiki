### Boss Behaviours
Phase 1: The boss will shoot out a few paralyze shots in all directions. These shots will do around 150 damage and can permanently paralyze you if the boss is still targeting you.

Phase 2: He will shoot out 3 slow shots in 4 directions, these shots are close together forcing you into certain areas. This phase is an easy damage phase if you look out for the occasional stun shots he shoots out.
If you still haven't kill the boss by this point he will heal then spawn in 2 minions that will follow you and paralyze you. A few seconds after these minions spawn the boss loops back into the first phase.
