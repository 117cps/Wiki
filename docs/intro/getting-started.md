# Welcome to Valor!

### If you're here from PROD, or totally new to the rotmg bullet hell-type games as a whole, this guide is for you!

Valor has an enormous quantity of original content and mechanics, that makes this game almost completely indistinguishable from PROD -- aside from the easily recognizeable artstyle. 

Located below is a map of the nexus and all of its useful landmarks.
