# Helpful Advice

## Getting Started

<i>When coming to Valor, we understand that it may be overwhelming at first when becoming emmirsed in the new content, learning enemy AI, and trying to memorize drops. Fortunately, we are an extremely welcoming community of players who have no problem of assisting newer players. Here are some helpful pointers to get you started!</i>

# Advice number 1:

As a new player, there is a lot to learn about Valor and its many mechanics. 
So my advice to you is to read up on them! Simply click on the "Mechanics" tab on the left , and you will see a large list of the various custom-made mechanics
Valor has to offer.

Feel free to either find out how they work yourself, or read up on the mechanics as you encounter them whilst playing the game. 
Reading up on all of the mechanics before you start playing the game grants you a better understanding of the game, but makes it feel as if studying for a test.
Figuring it out as you go along is certainly a viable and fun option! 

# Advice number 2:

Never be afraid of asking questions. Valor's many mechanics and additions of custom content may be confusing to some, so never be afraid of asking around in 
either the discord wiki's help desk channel, or asking around in the official valor discord's general chat. 

However, many questions one may have about how something works can likely be answered here, in the official wiki!
