## What is RWT?

Real World Trading (RWT) is when two players trade in-game items in exchange for real-world currnecies or the equivalent. Most commonly, you can expect to RWT with Paypal or Steam balance. There are special rules and regulations by Valor so as to provide the best experience for all users!

# Real World Trading Rules

     All buyer and seller accounts (anyone participating in #rwt), must have a fully linked Discord account to their ingame account. RWT without a linked account may result in RWT Blacklist or a ban.

    Exchanging other game's items (prod, OSRS, etc) is allowed but in the case it's an unsupported game it will receive no moderation support or help if the trade results in a scam. For any supported game's you'll be notified in #rwt-info channel.

    All talk in the #rwt channel should be strictly related to RWT offers. If you are discussing a deal, please do so in DMs.

    Buying duped/exploited items is allowed as you might not be aware of it, but keep in mind we will take away all the items a duper/exploiter sold if he is found out. It's on you to file a refund with him after that.

    Scamming and scam attempts are punishable with a permanent ban both on Discord and on Valor, on all accounts.

    Any support of payment plans ( ie. selling an item and paying it off day by day) is unsupported and will not receive support regardless of vouches.
