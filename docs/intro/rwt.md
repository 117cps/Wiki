# Real World Trading

## What is RWT?

Real World Trading (RWT) is when two players trade in-game items in exchange for real-world currnecies or the equivalent. Most commonly, you can expect to RWT with Paypal or Steam balance. There are special rules and regulations by Valor so as to provide the best experience for all users!

## How to Get Started

Go to the #bot channel of the Valor Discord, and run '/link'

The Valor Bot will send you a command and cde you have to write in-game to link your in-game account to Discord. This will give you access to #rwt

## Practicing Safe Trading

If you are contacted in-game to do a RWT trade, ask for their discord name. In the #bot channel of the Valor Discord, run '/ign @discordHandle' and double-check that is their linked account.

If anything feels off about a deal, you can open a ticket in the Valor Discord and express your concern. Valor Staff will respond as fast as possible. Open a general-ticket and simply say, "Hey, I am doing a trade with [Player Name], and when I mention a MM they don't want" or, "Hey, I am doing a trade with [Player Name], they are selling 30 LGs and their acc is like 5 stars". They will look.

To check a player's vouches, head to #bot in the Valor Disocrd and run '/vouches @discordHandle'. If you want to check vouches based off IGN/username, you can check their website profile [right here](https://valorserver.com/user/search?id=userName), and look for the "Vouches" badge. If they are linked and have atleast one vouch, it will show up.

# Real World Trading Rules

Exchanging other game items is unsupported ( This includes other private servers ). Meaning it will receive no Moderation Support nor help if the trade results in a scam. The only thing we can do from our side is a ban to the scammer from our server and Discord.

All talk in the #rwt channel should be strictly related to RWT offers. If you are discussing a deal, please do so in DMs.

Buying duped/exploited items will result in the Moderation team taking away all the items a duper/exploiter sold if he is found out. It's on you to file a refund with the user after that.

Scamming and scam attempts are punishable with a permanent ban both on Discord and on Valor, on all accounts.

Any support of payment plans ( ie. Selling an item and paying it off day by day is unsupported and will not receive support regardless of vouches. What this means: "If you break up a deal into multiple payments,e.g $50/m for four months", we don't support or offer any kind of assistance/coverage no matter their vouches. You may still enter into these, but like prod RWT or any other unsupported game, we will not be able to offer assistance other than a ban to the scammer )

Trading with someone with less than 5 vouches will result in no Moderation Support. Unless you would like to request a Moderator Middleman through our #create-ticket system. Moderators show up on our sidebar, and will generally MM for free or a small fee depending on how big the transaction is, etc.

(They will not handle physical funds in most cases, unless pre-agreed in writing by all parties.)***

## Payment Plans

Payment plans are officially unsupported. What this means: "If you break up a deal into multiple payments,e.g $50/m for four months", we don't support or offer any kind of assistance/coverage no matter their vouches. You may still enter into these, but like prod RWT or any other unsupported game, we will not be able to offer assistance other than a ban to the scammer.

Reason: This was a frequent problem across 2021, and was a major problem in the last few months. These don't fit well in our current vouch and tracking system, and open up the traders to multiple opportunities for something to go awry. It's almost impossible for us to keep track of what was paid, and overall does not seem to work in our ecosystem based on the amount of problems.
