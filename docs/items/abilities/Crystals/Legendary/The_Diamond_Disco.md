<i>This crystal was taken straight from the core of the funky robot D.1.S.K.0, its shine illuminates the area in a dazzling display of lights.</i>

**Essence of the Disco: On placement, this crystal will begin shooting rainbow colored beams in all directions, similar to D.1.S.K.0. Using this ability with an existing crystal will upgrade it instead of spawning another, which increases the number of beams as well as their damage**
