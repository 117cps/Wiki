# Alerts
Alerts are rare bosses that can be fought on any character provided you have an alert. You cannot die in any alert, you will instead be teleported to the nexus & lose 10% of your gold if you were to die in there.

## How to Gain Alerts
Every enemy or entity that dies within range of you has a 1/8000 chance to give you an alert with a purple message in chat, being in a guild increases this chance by 25%! You can also obtain Alert Tokens from the Battle Pass that give you alerts.
