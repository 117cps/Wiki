# Alerts
![Alerts](https://i.imgur.com/3Hc4Mkv.png)
Alerts are rare bosses that can be fought on any character provided you have an alert. You cannot die in any alert, you will instead be teleported to the nexus & lose 10% of your gold if you were to die in there.

## How to Gain Alerts
![AlertText](https://i.imgur.com/8Mk491e.png)
Every enemy or entity that dies within range of you has a 1/8000 chance to give you an alert with a purple message in chat, being in a guild increases this chance by 25%! You can also obtain Alert Tokens from the Battle Pass that give you alerts.  
Alert drop rates can also be occasionally doubled for events!
