# Ascension
Want to know why you can't drink vials yet? Welcome to ascension!

## Requirements
In order to ascend your character must first be 12/12 (Maxed every single stat with potions) and have 50000+ base fame. It also requires you to have 10 stars on your account. (Occasionally less base fame if there's an event going on, but not usually the case)



## Lost Scripture 1
![LS1](https://vwiki.valorserver.com/api/item/picture/Lost%20Scripture)  

Lost Scripture 1 is a drop from Elite Lootboxes & Aldragine at the end of the zol raid, it can also be found on the marketplace or traded normally.  
When consumed it will unlock the ability to buy Marks & Nodes on that character for onrane.

### Marks and Nodes

## Lost Scripture 2

Lost Scripture 2 is a drop from Elite Lootboxes, Drannol at the end of the titan raid and Merganus at the end of the fallen raid, it can also be found on the marketplace or traded normally.  
When consumed it will allow your character to drink 10 vials of every stat, allowing yourself to become 24/24 and also count as being Ascended for things like shining!  
Vials can be made by dragging 2 greater potions onto eachother (you can also do that to make greater potions out of regular potions) or as a drop from harder dungeons & raid bosses!


### Super Scriptures

Super Scriptures are rare rewards from the battlepass that work like regular lost scriptures but only require 25k base fame to use!


## Philosopher's Stone

The Philosopher's Stone is an AR tier consumable that ascends your character instantly with both scriptures right from the start with no requirements. It also grants a backpack. It drops from Trials, or can be obtained from a philosopher's crate if lucky.
