# Aspects
Aspects are per-account unlockable "perks" that you can be applied & removed onto any of your characters at any time.

## Aspect Hall
The aspect hall is where you select aspects on your character, it is located to the right side of the nexus or you can use /aspecthall ingame to go there at any time.

### Starter Aspects
There are 3 aspects that every account starts with unlocked for free, those are:  
**Aspect of Power:** +50 HP, +5 Attack, +5 Dexterity  
**Aspect of Support:** +80 HP, +10 Wisdom, +10 Vitality  
**Aspect of Utility:** +80 HP, +8 Defense, +8 Speed

## Aspect Unlocking
Various bosses in valor will drop aspects that can then be combined with an Aspect Enfuser to unlock that aspect on your account.
Aspect Enfusers are forged by an Ancient Rune(200k Fame in the nexus or bought from marketplace) + a Legendary Sor Crystal.
