# The Battle Pass
Valor features an extensive battle pass system, granting extra rewards & obtectives for players to grind towards and obtain exclusive items. Battle Pass season reset every 3 months and are always active for every player.

## Where is the battle pass?

At any time you can check your battle pass level, xp, rewards, and missions from the battlepass npc lady in the nexus. She is  just to the left in a unique structure as you walk up from spawn going towards the realm portal.


## Levelling
You level up your battle pass & gain xp by completing Missions & accomplishing various ingame tasks like slaying bosses or maxing characters! Each level requires progressively more xp than the mission before it.  
Gaining XP will be shown as a text notification above your character and you can always check your current level or xp at the npc.

To help players level up their battle pass there are 3 different types of missions they can complete for xp. Daily missions (Green), Weekly Missions (Blue), and Seasonal Missions (Yellow)  
Every day players recieve 5 daily missions worth 200 exp each, every week they get 2 weekly missions worth 5874 exp each and every battle pass season they get a large amount of long-term seasonal missions worth 6766 exp each. Missions do not carry over and if you do not complete them in their alotted time your progress on those missions will be lost!


## Rewards

Each level of the battle pass opens up one reward for you, with an extra reward per level if you have consumed the Premium Battle Pass item which is bought with kantos or traded between players. These rewards are usually helpful currencies for players, housing furniture, or exclusive cosmetics like skins or Orbs of Transformation that allow you reskin equipment to unique themes.  
When claimed these rewards appear in your gift chest, though it is usually better to move these items into your inventory before using them to avoid any potential bugs.
