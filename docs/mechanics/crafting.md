# Crafting  
Crafting and forging items is a very important part of Valor as it is how a lot of later gear & progression is obtained.

## The Forge
The forge is located in the nexus, just up and right of the spawn location.  
The order you put items in does matter, and it is generally the more universial item (LSor, Shine, Essence) on the left and then the other item to the right of that. If your forging does not work try swapping the order first!


## Shards
Shards are rare legendary items obtained as drops from various bosses or from elite lootboxes that can all be combined with a Legendary Sor Crystal in order to forge a shard-specific legendary item!

## Shines
Shines are a rare soulbound drop dropping from any boss in the game, forging them with a suitable legendary item will allow you to reroll it into a random legendary from any shard pool for a fee of gold!

### Shine Cost
By default shines will cost 75000 to use when forged, but this can be lowered in two ways.  
If your character is ascended (successfully used a Lost Scripture 2) the cost will be lowered by 10000.
If there is a shine booster currently active the cost will be lowered by 5000 for all players.  
You can always check the current shine cost on your character by doing `/sc` ingame. The cheapest possible shine cost is 60000 gold.

### Shinable Items
All legendaries that come from shards and *most* that are legendary drops from bosses. Any legendaries that come from essence or esor upgrading cannot be shined.


##  Elemental Rune Enchanting
Most very rare & powerful Ancient Relic items can be enchanted with the four elemental runes in order to upgrade & specalize them, all of these AR upgrades can be removed with the plain Ancient Rune item purchasable for fame.  
Speedier Sprout can also be upgraded with a Anicent Air Rune, turning it into the Speediest Sprout.  
Fire Enchants usually boost damage, Air Enchants usually boost speed or fire rate, Earth Enchants usually boost survivability, Water Enchants usually boost mana or range.

### Elemental Rune Drop Locations
Air: Crypt of the Illusionist, Fallen Raid Merganus the Titan
Earth: Garden of Chaos, Fallen Raid xxx bosss
Fire: Crimson Showdown, Ascended Abyss, Fallen Raid Titans & Fire Wizards
Water: Tunnel of Pain, Fallen Raid xxx boss


## Aspect Enfusers
Aspect Enfusers are made at the forge with an Ancient Rune & a Legendary Sor Crystal, this will also cost 75000 gold to forge.
