# Crafting  
Crafting and forging items is a very important part of Valor as it is how a lot of later gear & progression is obtained.

## The Forge
![The Forge](https://i.imgur.com/RxCCVdg.png)  
The forge is located in the nexus, just up and right of the spawn location.  
The order you put items in does matter, and it is generally the more universial item (LSor, Shine, Essence) on the left and then the other item to the right of that. If your forging does not work try swapping the order first!


## Shards
Shards are rare legendary items obtained as drops from various bosses or from elite lootboxes that can all be forged with a Legendary Sor Crystal in order to obtain a random legendary equip from that item's shard pool!

### Drop Locations

### Shard Pools

## Essence of the Realm
![Essence](https://i.imgur.com/ojy2uHE.png)  
Essence of the Realm is a crafting maerial used to upgrade certain lower tiered items into powerful Legendary equipment, using the Essence to upgrade an item costs 100 onrane. (75 if in a T3 or above guild.)

### How To Earn
![Piece](https://i.imgur.com/xFlaOlI.png)  
All ascended versions of godlands dungeons (UDL, Lab, Sprite, Snake, Abyss, Rift, Tunnel of Pain) have a rare chance to drop a Piece of the Realm, you can forge two of them together at the forge into an Essence of the Realm! The Essence is soulbound but items crafted with it are not and people still buy & sell essence crafting services.

### Upgrade List

## Elemental Sors
![ESor](https://i.imgur.com/NAQXhqa.png)  
Elemental Sors work similarly to Essences but are cheaper to make & work on a different pool of items! Crafting with them has a 10% chance of failing!

### How to Earn
Elemental Sors are soulbound but made with an Ancient Rune (bought with 200k fame in the nexus) + Any Elemental (Air/Earth/Fire/Water) Rune at the forge. They also have a chance to drop from the Elemental Phantom realm event.

*Could use visuals, missing new Wand of Obscurity craft*


## Shines
![Shines](https://i.imgur.com/mEXNIDL.png)  
Shines are a rare soulbound drop dropping from any boss in the game, forging them with a suitable legendary item will allow you to reroll it into a random legendary from any shard pool for a fee of gold!

### Shine Cost
By default shines will cost 75000 to use when forged, but this can be lowered in two ways.  
If your character is ascended (successfully used a Lost Scripture 2) the cost will be lowered by 10000.
If there is a shine booster currently active the cost will be lowered by 5000 for all players.  
You can always check the current shine cost on your character by doing `/sc` ingame. The cheapest possible shine cost is 60000 gold.

### Shinable Items
All legendaries that come from shards and *most* that are legendary drops from bosses can be shined. Any legendaries that come from essence or esor upgrading cannot be shined.


##  Elemental Rune Enchanting
![Elemental Runes](https://i.imgur.com/dQRr6s3.png)  
Most very rare & powerful Ancient Relic items can be enchanted with the four elemental runes in order to upgrade & specalize them, all of these AR upgrades can be removed with the plain Ancient Rune item purchasable for fame.  
Speedier Sprout can also be upgraded with a Anicent Air Rune, turning it into the Speediest Sprout.  
Fire Enchants usually boost damage, Air Enchants usually boost speed or fire rate, Earth Enchants usually boost survivability, Water Enchants usually boost mana or range.

### Elemental Rune Drop Locations
Air: Crypt of the Illusionist, Fallen Raid Merganus the Titan  
Earth: Garden of Chaos, Fallen Raid xxx boss  
Fire: Crimson Showdown, Ascended Abyss, Fallen Raid Titans & Fire Wizards  
Water: Tunnel of Pain, Fallen Raid xxx boss
