# Crafting  
Crafting is a very important part of Valor! xxx

## The Forge
The forge is located in the nexus, just up and right of the spawn location.  
The order you put items in does matter, and it is generally the more universial item (LSor, Shine, Essence) on the left and then the other item to the right of that.


## Shards
Shards are rare legendary items obtained as drops from various bosses or from elite lootboxes that can all be combined with a Legendary Sor Crystal in order to forge a shard-specific legendary item!

##  Elemental Rune Enchanting
Most very rare & powerful Ancient Relic items can be enchanted with the four elemental runes in order to upgrade & specalize them.  
All of these upgrades can be removed with the plain Ancient Rune item purchasable for fame.
