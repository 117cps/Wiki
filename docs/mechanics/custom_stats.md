# Custom Stats
Valor has lots of custom stats on both your character & on items that are important to understand.


## Surge & Prot
You can find your Surge(SG) & Prot(PT) bars below your mana bar on every character.  
![Bars](http://prntscr.com/f80MmK-MFLy1)
Your prot bar acts as a shield for damage protecting your health until your bar is fully depleted. The amount of prot you have is determined by your Protection stat & your max hp.  
Your surge bar goes up by 2 whenever an enemy dies near you, if it stays still for 5 seconds it will being dropping quickly. When your surge reaches 100 your prot bar will fully refill and your surge will reset to 0.


## 12/12 & New Maxable Stats
Valor also adds 4 new stats that every character can max to become 12/12 instead of 8/8, each class has their own unique stat caps for all of these. Mechanics & items that require a player to be maxed(12/12) require all of these to be maxed!  

### Luck
Luck raises your critical hit chance, every 10 luck gives you an extra 1% chance to hit a critical hit.

### Might
Might effects your critical hit damage multiplier, every 76 might you have increases your serverside crit multiplier by 1x.  
x Being how much might you have:  
0 ≤ x < 76 = 1x crits (does no bonus damage)  
76 ≤ x < 152 = 2x crits  
152 ≤ x < 228 = 3x crits  
228 ≤ x < 304 = 4x crits  
304 ≤ x < 380 = 5x crits (crit multipliers past 4x require a high amount of ATTACK as well as might in order to hit)  

### Restoration
Higher Restoration increases the amount of hp/mp you heal from consumables and potions. It also increases the amount of potions you get upon entereing the nexus up to a cap of 4 hp/mp potions that heal 260 each.

### Protection
Your Protection stat determines how high your full Prot bar is.


## Life Steal & Mana Leech
Every Life Steal & Mana Leech you have makes you regenerate that amount of health or mana upon hitting any enemy with a projectile. Invulnerable enemies do work but not invincible ones. (enemies that non-piercing shots pass through)  
These work on all weapon shots & certain abilities that shoot projectiles like spells & quivers but not with aoe abilities like poisons, skulls, scepters or traps.


## Fortune
Every 1 fortune you have increases your loot boost by 1% (check with `/lb` ingame), which is factored in only when an enemy dies and not at any point before that.


## Healing Boost & Mana Healing Boost
Healing Boost increases the amount you regen from priest tome heals and the healing effect.  
Mana Healing Boost increases the amount you regen from the templar's empowered buff.
