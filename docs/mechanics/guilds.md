# Guilds
Guilds are expanded upon in Valor, having a rank & xp system to reward active guilds with beneficial perks.

## Guild Exp & Rank
Gulids gain exp by having members playing the game and once the guild reaches enough exp it will go up to the next rank, unlocking perks for every guild member. Check your guild's exp and rank by running `/ginfo` ingame.
