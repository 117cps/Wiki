# Housing
Valor is home to Housing, a system that lets players create houses to hang out in or access certain tiles & placable objects.

## The Home Depot
The Home Depot is where most housing content can be bought or accessed, with a few others coming as rewards from the battle pass. It is located at all the green wizards in the nexus.

Items in the will cost either Gold, Fame, Kantos, or Onrane and you can upgrade your max housing size with gold or kantos via the green allow in the top left of the menu shop.

## House Editing

The Housing Editor can be found on the main menu at the bottom right of your characters screen.

Clicking it will open the editor where you can place the tiles & objects you have on your account in any configuration you want (as long as you have a spawn location) and then Save(Submit) it to the server for you or anyone else to visit later.

## Visiting Houses
The command `/vhome [playername]` can be ran ingame to visit their housing, this works for your own house as well. Anybody can do this at any time, even if the owner is offline or elsewhere in Valor.

## Functionality
The main draws of housing are for creating art, showing off your wealth with an expensive house, having somewhere private for popping keys or what have you, or for using private target dummies to test your damage or other effects.
