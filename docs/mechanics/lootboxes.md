Valor has various types of lootboxes obtained from playing that all have separate item pools & drop locations. These can all be checked & opened from the silver lootbox menu located at the top left of your screen in the nexus & vault! All items gotten from lootboxes appear in your gift chest.

## Tiered Loot Boxes
Gold, Silver, and Bronze Loot Boxes drop from most realm events and contain potions, keys, and low level UT items.
