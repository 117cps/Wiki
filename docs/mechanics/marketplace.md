# Marketplace
The marketplace is very important part for all Valor players that want to quickly buy or sell items! Note that elite accounts CANNOT use the marketplace at all!

## How the marketplace works
Any player can put any item onto the marketplace for almost any price, the only exception is that Legendary and above items have a minimum price of 10000 gold. Once an item is on the marketplace it will stay on it for a couple of months, or until removed by the person that put it up.
There is a 3 star requirement for putting an item onto the market, but no requirement to buy items.

### The Ground
In the marketplace itself you can find various sections dedicated to rotating through different types of items that are on the market, you can find potions & consumables at the very top, other misc items at the very bottom, weapons above, rings to the left, armors to the right, and abilities below. When buying from ground be careful & make sure the item you're standing on hasn't changed!

### Market GUI
You can access the marketplace gui from any of the human npcs dotted about the room. Clicking it will allow you to see & sort every item that's on the marketplace, see all of the items you have on the market & remove them if wanted, or put up an offer.

### Market-related Commands
