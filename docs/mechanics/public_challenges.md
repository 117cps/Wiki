# Public Challenges
Public Challenges are rewarding bosses that are summoned whenever 5 Insignias of Valor are popped in the nexus. You can check in the nexus how many insigs have been popped by using `/cc`. Once popped an announcement is put into chat & the notification squad discord channel and the portal appears  northeast of the spawn where the Challenges text is located and lasts for 30 seconds.
