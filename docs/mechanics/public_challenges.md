# Public Challenges
Public Challenges are rewarding bosses that are summoned whenever 5 Insignias of Valor are popped in the nexus. You can check in the nexus how many insigs have been popped by using `/cc`. Once popped the portal spawns to the right & up of the spawn where the Challenges text is located and lasts for 30 seconds.  
The challenge will be one of three boss only dungeons, which are listed in more detail below.  


## Malgor
Appears 100% of the time on Mondays. Watch out for super mega hot lava & very high damage meteor shots!

## Ulgur
Appears 100% of the time on Saturdays. Watch out for condensed shotguns & clones spawning!

## Serenity the Ripper
Appears 100% of the time on Wednesdays. Watch out for high damage dangerous shotgun bursts, or sitting on minions or lava!
