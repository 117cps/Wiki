# Raids
Raids are some of Valor's hardest & most rewarding content, being server-wide dungeons with their own mechanics & bosses that are home to equipment exclusive to their walls.

## Raid Tokens

In order to start a raid a player must use any of the 3 raid tokens in the ascension enclave, this will spawn a portal that stays open for 2 minutes before disappearing. Tokens come as a soulbound drop from Oryx the Mad God 2 & 3 or from tradable Token Crates that can be found on the player marketplace.

## Ascension Enclave

The Ascension Enclave is where all raid tokens have to be popped & where the raid portal appears when done so, there are no requirements to enter it and it is always accessible either from running '/enclave' or vsiting the portal in the bottom right of the nexus.
