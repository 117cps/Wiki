# Trials
![Trial Icon](https://i.imgur.com/zyOu61C.png)  
Trials are a mechanic special to valor which allow you to fight unique bosses with saved up trial tokens! Each boss drops both it's own unique loot and useful currencies & items like gold, onrane and sor.


## Trial Tokens

Each day you can complete one Trial Contract obtained with `/daily` by killing realm events, upon completion you will get a base of 10 trial tokens increased by 2 for every LS1 you have consumed on an character & 3 for every LS2 you have consumed on an alive character! Trial Tokens can also be obtained from the battlepass, and the current cap for the amount of daily tokens you can have is 110.
