# How to Contribute to the Wiki

Want to be a wiki nerd? Want to simply just be a good samaritan fixing wiki changes for players who come after you? Perfect! By using the edit this page button you can make edits to a change that will be proposed! After a review by an established Wiki Nerd, your change could be made!

## Editing the docs  
By clicking the 'Edit this page' button below any page on the wiki it will open a github tab with a little pencil button that will let you see the code being the wiki page, nearly every page is written in Markdown formatting.  
When you are editing the writing of the pages be careful to not mess up any formatting or code as that will cause issues with the wiki, and try to write everything with proper grammar & english to not confuse anyone reading the wiki.

Once you have finished scroll to the bottom of the page & describe the changes you are proposing and click the big green button saying 'Propose changes' and then click 'Create pull request' twice on the next page, this will open up a pull request that one of the wiki workers can look over & accept to add your changes to the wiki!
