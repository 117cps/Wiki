# RWT

RWT (standing for Real World Trading) is when two users trade in-game items in exchange for real-world currencies or equivalent. The most common RWT method is via PayPal or steam balance. Valor regulates this to provide the best experience for all users!

## If you wish to RWT, it is IMPERATIVE that you read this article below. It contains everything you need to know about how to RWT, and advice regarding RWT.

## IMPORTANT WARNINGS ! 

(these warnings can be found on the aforementioned article, but are posted here for ease of access)

If you are contacted in-game or in Discord to do an RWT trade, you should ask for their discord/in-game name, and run /ign @User in #bot channel to double-check that their account is linked. After running /ign you should follow with /vouches to see if the user has 5 or more vouches. Also check if they are banned here https://valorserver.com/ban-tracker

If anything feels off about a deal, you can open up a ticket and express your concern. As always, we'll try to be as fast as possible. You can open a general ticket and simply say, "Hey, I'm doing a trade with X, and when I mention a MM they don't want" or, "Hey, I'm doing a trade with X, they are selling 30 LGs and their acc is like 5 stars". We'll take a look.

IF you are skeptical about any trade whatsoever, make them go in-game to message you to get their in-game name or to prove their items/gold, get their Discord ID, PayPal email, anything that can save us both the trouble if a scam does occur.

ALWAYS CHECK OUR BLOG FOR BANNED PAYPAL EMAILS/DISCORD/PLAYERS BEFORE DOING A TRADE. ( https://blog.valorserver.com/banned-players/ - the bottom is always up to date.)
RWTing with someone who is not Verified in our discord is a bannable offense. "I didn't know" is not an excuse. It's very easy to check that and vouches. Anyone selling goods outside of Valor obtained them through malicious uses, and we would not suggest buying them. Users who have been cracked into will want it back. Furthermore, they frequently scam and most people involved have been banned in the past for chargebacks.

Trading with someone with less than 5 vouches will result in no Moderation Support. Unless you would like to request a Moderator Middleman through our #create-ticket-system. Moderators show up on our sidebar, and will generally MM for free or a small fee depending on how big the transaction is, etc.
Note - Any decision by a moderator is final. They may ban/punish for reasons not stated here if they feel your intent is to be destructive or harmful to the server and/or the community. That includes RWT deals that were not followed as per our RWT rules.
