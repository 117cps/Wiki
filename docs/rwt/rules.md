# Rules


## 1. RWTing with someone who is not Verified in our discord is a bannable offense. "I didn't know" is not an excuse. It's very easy to check that and vouches. 

## 2. Do not buy items obtained through illicit means (duping, account cracking, etc).  

## 3. Charging back a rwt transaction is a bannable offense (this is where the buyer requests their bank to return the money spent). 

## 4. If we feel your offer or request is dangerous/scammer bait, or will contribute to the influx of problems we have seen, it will be removed.

### If you have questions, feel free to request an explanation in a ticket.
