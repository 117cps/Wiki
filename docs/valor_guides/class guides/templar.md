The Templar is a heavy armor lance class that uses banners to support his allies and buff himself. The Templar while not changing too much since his addition has been phased out of meta due to competing with Mechanic and Tepcal.


# Lances

**Lances are a very powerful weapon type that sacrifce range; They generally have much higher base damage then other weapon types and pierce defense.**

The Elemental Lance and Moon Crescent Halberd offer high damage at a long range 5.4 and 5 respectively. The Elemental Lance has more dmg and range with Halberd having better on equip stats and passive that makes you immune to slow when below 50% MP.

The Dragonslayer Lance, Ioks Courage, And Zol Trident are lances that exchange range for a boost in DPS. 

 - The Zol Trident provides the highest DPS of the 3 offering DPS similar to the Orbis Terrae at a much cheaper price point.
  
 - With Ioks courage providing the lowest but having exclant on equip stats.

Overall these are good options if you are willing to take the hit to range.

The Absolute Crescendo was historically a very good lance providing the highest DPS of its time, Has sadly fallen out of meta due to a heavy nerf. While having the lowest DPS of all LG Lances it is a serviceable option for npes and lower budget players.

The Orbis Terrae is the most powerful LG lance providing the highest DPS at a large 5.4 range, This power does come with a downside of being rare/expensive. If you can afford this lance it is highly worth using.

The Implacable Ram while not seeming like much at first glance providing mediocre dmg and range, The real power comes from its stun allowing the templar to fill the role of knight. While not good for dmg it is a very fun weapon to play with.


# Banners

**Banner's Give Empowered in a radius, Most provide Invulnerable for a short period.**

The Jester's Tattered Cloth is the best general purpose banner, Giving Berserk and Armoured for 5 seconds on a 6 second cooldown; The second highest uptime of self buffs on all banners. It also provides 12 Dex and 2 Life Steal improving DPS and survivability by a small amount. Overall if you can afford this extremely rare item it is worth it.

If you can't afford jesters or want to run a crit build the Beacon of the Void is for you; Giving Damaging and Bravery for 3 seconds with a cooldown of 7. While being the only double buff banner it is stripped of being BIS due to its long cooldown.

The Banner of Last Resort and Victorious banner provide the largest empowered radiuses.

 - Last Resort Provides it in a 9 tile radius and Invulnerable for 1.5 seconds It does however have the downside of bleeding for 4 seconds on use.

 - The Victory Banner, while giving no (Useful) Stat bonuses and no Invulnerable, is much cheaper and gives empowered in 8 tiles.

The Banner of the Furious Kraken (Commonly referred to as kraken banner) Is the BIS for Templars looking to support the group, Providing a wismod Max MP increase on group and 1.5 seconds of Invulnerable.

The Horrific Limb is an odd banner throwing a poison, giving Damaging for 3 seconds and Invulnerable for 0.75 seconds on a cooldown of 3 seconds; This ironically gives it the highest uptime of DPS buffs and Invulnerable but due to its poison you will need Mana Leech to use it properly.
