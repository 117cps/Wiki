## Suggestions and Bug Reports

![waow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106563707/193391705-217ad3e8-4181-45a7-aea2-da6c75735643.png)

Wanna assist the Valor Wiki? Perfect! By making an [Issue Report](https://github.com/Valor-Inc/Wiki/issues), you can make suggestions on what you think should be on the Valor Wiki, as well as make bug reports on pages! This system allows for players to point out these bugs immediately, you don't even need to come here to access that page! Simply clicking the 'Edit this Page' button on any page; and then clicking 'Issues' on Github, you can make a suggestion or bug report!

You will need to create a Github account--but trust me--it will take you no time at all to make. It will take you around 5 seconds and you could be contributing to a great cause, helping players get the best information possible. Today, we have a Valor Player who seems to have stumbled across a Page Error!

Simply fill out the information surrounded with the Red Boxes. It is all within a template and will appear there for you to fill out with your specific information! For screenshots, simply Ctrl + V--copy and pasting--the image in will cause it to appear in the ![image](link) format.

## Editing the Wiki

![EditingPage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106563707/193392739-004015f9-3814-4935-8412-871a4fb41d28.png)

Alright, I get it! You are the type of person who loves to get things done quick and you wanna make sure we are too. By clicking the 'Edit this page' button at the bottom of any page, you can fix bugs yourself!

![avalanche](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106563707/193392878-cccff701-0ae2-4afa-a18c-8d91790b331a.png)

Clicking that button will take you here, the Github page for the item. By clicking the Pencil, you will be allowed to **edit** this page.

![editted](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106563707/193393018-b8d8fef7-22f9-4bc7-ae0c-7a213e6cfeaf.png)

After editting the page and correcting all bugs, click the **Propose Changes** button. This will open a Pull Request for the Wiki Nerds to review. If you did a good job, lets just say you will not be waiting too long to see that Avalanche change you wanted so badly!

![congrats](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106563707/193393086-1f00a3ad-1b71-4ef6-bc17-0bd247a70f0a.png)

Wow Valor Player, great job! You are now officially a Wiki Nerd whether you like it or not! We are glad to have you and appreciate your hard work. Keep the hard work up and it will be worth it!
