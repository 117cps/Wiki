## **Common Problems**

**AUTO-UPDATER**

**Might trigger Anti-Viruses because it remotely fetches our valor.zip and unpacks it. If this is a problem, you may update manually.**
    
 - Some anti-viruses claim it as a false positive due to it not being signed, try disabling your AV if it doesn't work. You can check the code or just run it Sandboxie if you really want to.

 - If you're getting a black screen (pure black, no 'loading...') install Visual C++ from [Here 32 bit](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) or [Here 64 bit](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
    
 - If you have registered but cannot connect to the nexus make sure you have selected a username. This is done via the "Play" Menu.

 - Want to hide taskbar on windows? (find the display setting: automatically hide taskbar while in desktop mode).
    
 - AMD has an issue with drivers past version: 22.5.

    *Solution:
    Go to www.amd.com/en/support and to find your graphics card FINDING the right one is important after they have done so click submit, find your version of windows, and download a driver of 226 or earlier
    Once downloaded open it up, and install it will downgrade your drivers to a previous version that works with Valor Anytime you wish to upgrade just update how you usually do it.*

 - If you have registered but cannot connect to the nexus make sure you have selected a username. This is done via the "Play" Menu.

## **Mac and Linux Support**

We do not have native Mac or Linux ports, but there has been success stories running Valor under wine.
