# In Game

 - Exploiting of any kind is **NOT** tolerated.
    - If caught, the punishment and punishment length is determined by the severity of the exploit. This is including but definitely **NOT** limited to: duping, shot pattern switching, elite account exploits. If you have to ask if what you're doing is an exploit, it probably is and you may want to contact a moderator to find out if you're breaking this rule.

 - Do **NOT** beg for items.
 
 - Do **NOT** gamble.
 
 - Do **NOT** attempt to ruin the gameplay experience for other users.
 
 - Do **NOT** rush ahead in large dungeons such as Titan Lava Walk.
 
 - Do **NOT** “key”. This is where you open a key over top of a raid portal.
 
 - Do **NOT** harass, or purposefully kill other players. (E.g, using group speedy right beside lava with clear intent to kill, Avalanche to kill Blade Masters.)
 
 - Do **NOT** associate with cheaters.
 
 - Do **NOT** use an objectionable username. (You will be renamed)
 
 - Follow all Ingame Chat rules below where applicable. E.g, disregard anything about images.
 
 - No indecent themes. No attacking other uses through slurs, or anything that can be constructed as harassment.
 
 - Harassment of other users will **NOT** be tolerated. This includes threats, repetitive name calling, or harassment of a person's family and/or personal life.

 - Anyone caught redistributing the testing client to non donors will forfeit their rank/and or risk a ban.

<TabItem value="Discord And In Game Chat" label="Discord And In Game Chat" default>

# Discord And In Game Chat

 - Until the Discord bot handles Notification Squad, double pings will result in 3 strikes.
 
 - **ONLY** ping staff in appropriate situations. Please use our support channels first.
 
 - Follow all pinned message rules in channels, and chat in the proper channels.
 
 - Like the rule above, pings for something other than the pinned allowed things will also result in 3 strikes. This includes false pings. An exhaustive list of allowed pings is in #notification-squad.
 
 - Speaking non-English will be met with warnings, and if continued will result in a timed mute, with the time determined on a case-by-case basis. We cannot moderate a language we cannot speak, and would prefer even minor things such as memes in other languages to stay in DMs or other Discord servers that allow it.
 
 - Do **NOT** discuss sexual or indecent themes.
 
 - Harassment of other users will **NOT** be tolerated. This includes threats, repetitive name calling, or harassment of a person's family and/or personal life.
 
 - Do **NOT** post harmful content.
    - This includes but is not limited to steam stealers, hacked clients, NSFW content. Anything that could bring harm to another user or Valor itself. This includes partial nudity.

 - Do **NOT** be homophobic or use homophobic slurs.

<TabItem value="RWT" label="RWT" default>

# RWT
 
 - Exchanging other game items is unsupported ( This includes other private servers ). Meaning it will receive no Moderation Support nor help if the trade results in a scam. The only thing we can do from our side is a ban to the scammer from our server and Discord.

 - All talk in the #rwt channel should be strictly related to RWT offers. If you are discussing a deal, please do so in DMs.

 - Buying duped/exploited items will result in the Moderation team taking away all the items a duper/exploiter sold if he is found out. It's on you to file a refund with the user after that.

 - Scamming and scam attempts are punishable with a permanent ban both on Discord and on Valor, on all accounts.

 - Any support of payment plans ( ie. Selling an item and paying it off day by day is unsupported and will not receive support regardless of vouches. What this means: "If you break up a deal into multiple payments,e.g $50/m for four months", we don't support or offer any kind of assistance/coverage no matter their vouches. You may still enter into these, but like prod RWT or any other unsupported game, we will not be able to offer assistance other than a ban to the scammer )

 - Trading with someone with less than 5 vouches will result in no Moderation Support. Unless you would like to request a Moderator Middleman through our #create-ticket system. Moderators show up on our sidebar, and will generally MM for free or a small fee depending on how big the transaction is, etc.

 - (They will not handle physical funds in most cases, unless pre-agreed in writing by all parties.)

 **Any decision by a moderator is final. They may ban/punish for reasons not stated here if they feel your intent is to be destructive or harmful to the server and/or the community. That includes RWT deals that were not followed as per our RWT rules.**

# Payment Plans

**Payment plans are officially unsupported. What this means: "If you break up a deal into multiple payments,e.g $50/m for four months", we don't support or offer any kind of assistance/coverage no matter their vouches. You may still enter into these, but like prod RWT or any other unsupported game, we will not be able to offer assistance other than a ban to the scammer.**

### Reason
 - This was a frequent problem across 2021, and was a major problem in the last few months. These don't fit well in our current vouch and tracking system, and open up the traders to multiple opportunities for something to go awry. It's almost impossible for us to keep track of what was paid, and overall does not seem to work in our ecosystem based on the amount of problems.

# Refund

**Must have a first-person recording of what happened.**
**You are limited to a maximum of two approved refunds within a 30 day period. When opening a refund ticket be extremely careful about what you want to have refunded, tiered items are worse to refund than a character with legendary item's/ancient relic's.**
 
 Refunds will only be for Server related issues. This is including but not limited to:

    - Frame skipping due to high stressed instances. This will NOT be "I frame skipped two tiles and died, i would have survived!"

    - Server crashing and rollbacks (specific instances, will be determined when it happens, and this is specifically due to the server crashing, not you crashing. Very different scenarios.)

    - Bugs that have to do with behaviors of certain mobs. This will NOT be a "oryx dashed to me and killed me in 0 seconds I had no time to react" or "i was sitting on oryx and suddenly i instantly died", this will be limited to stacked shots and misc, Things like Zaragon or raids.


Refunds will NOT be for the following:
 
    - Internet/PC issues that cause you to die.

    - Dragging deaths. The person dragging can be punished, but you will not receive a refund. It is your responsibility to not leech/AFK in a spot you are not safe in.

    - Suggestively fabricated scenarios different from the one that transpired in your death. Some people think they're real slick trying to get refunds for mistakes that are not our fault. This happens a lot, if you don't nexus or you panic and die, this still doesn't make the refund valid, it just shows a lack of effort in wanting to live. Risk versus reward.

    - Sob stories about how you know you don't have a video to back up the claim yet you swear that it happened. These will be instantly ignored.

    - Hacked accounts. This is due to one of three things, the first one being it's our fault and the database is leaked, which will never happen. Second being that you used your password and email from another website or private server that was stolen from their database. Third being that you actually have a really bad password and it was easily brute forced. Please choose a respectable password and do not re-use your passwords anywhere else.

    - AFK or tabbed out deaths.

    - Purposefully sitting on mobs and dying.

    - Not having a first-person recording of what happened.

# Misc Refund Rules

 - Lies, misleading statements, or edited clips will result in a permanent ban both in-game and Discord.
 - You should not be making a refund ticket for every death. We will limit you if we feel it is excessive or spam.
 - Refunds are not quick business. You are asking us to revive your character from the dead. Be prepared to wait.
 - Refunds for deaths must be made within the first five days. Refund for everything else such as items is two weeks.
 - Referencing another refund ticket/user or clip as supporting evidence for why you should be refunded will instantly result in a deny.
 - Abuse or verbal harassment of the moderation team inside of tickets will result in a mute/ticket-ban, and other escalating punishments.
 - Opening more refund ticket's after having two already approved will result in a ticket-ban.
