# In Game

 - Exploiting of any kind is **NOT** tolerated.
    - If caught, the punishment and punishment length is determined by the severity of the exploit. This is including but definitely **NOT** limited to: duping, shot pattern switching, elite account exploits. If you have to ask if what you're doing is an exploit, it probably is and you may want to contact a moderator to find out if you're breaking this rule.
 - Do **NOT** beg for items.
 - Do **NOT** gamble.
 - Do **NOT** attempt to ruin the gameplay experience for other users.
 - Do **NOT** rush ahead in large dungeons such as Titan Lava Walk.
 - Do **NOT** “key”. This is where you open a key over top of a raid portal.
 - Do **NOT** harass, or purposefully kill other players. (E.g, using group speedy right beside lava with clear intent to kill.)
 - Do **NOT** associate with cheaters.
 - Do **NOT** use an objectionable username. (You will be renamed)
 - Follow all Ingame Chat rules below where applicable. E.g, disregard anything about images.
 - No indecent themes. No attacking other uses through slurs, or anything that can be constructed as harassment.
 - Harassment of other users will **NOT** be tolerated. This includes threats, repetitive name calling, or harassment of a person's family and/or personal life.

# Discord And In Game Chat

 - Until the Discord bot handles Notification Squad, double pings will result in 3 strikes.
 - **ONLY** ping staff in appropriate situations. Please use our support channels first.
 - Follow all pinned message rules in channels, and chat in the proper channels.
 - Like the rule above, pings for something other than the pinned allowed things will also result in 3 strikes. This includes false pings. An exhaustive list of allowed pings is in #notification-squad.
 - Speaking non-English will be met with warnings, and if continued will result in a timed mute, with the time determined on a case-by-case basis. We cannot moderate a language we cannot speak, and would prefer even minor things such as memes in other languages to stay in DMs or other Discord servers that allow it.
 - Do **NOT** discuss sexual or indecent themes.
 - Harassment of other users will **NOT** be tolerated. This includes threats, repetitive name calling, or harassment of a person's family and/or personal life. 
 - Do **NOT** post harmful content.
    - This includes but is not limited to steam stealers, hacked clients, NSFW content. Anything that could bring harm to another user or Valor itself. This includes partial nudity.
 - Do **NOT** be homophobic or use homophobic slurs.

<TabItem value="RWT" label="RWT" default>

# RWT
 
 - **ONLY** trade with users that have the “Verified” role on discord.
 - If a trade feels suspicious - report it.
 - **ONLY** vouch traders you have traded with.
 - See full terms and policies for RWT - as outlined in #refund-and-support-info.
 - Scamming and scam attempts are punishable with a permanent ban both on Discord and on Valor, on all accounts
 - Exchanging other game's items' (prod, osrs, etc) is allowed but we offer **ZERO SUPPORT.**
 - Buying duped/exploited items is allowed as you might not be aware of it, but keep in mind we will take away all the items a duper/exploiter sold if he is found out. It's on you to file a refund with him after that.
 - By participating in RWT - you acknowledge you might be requested to provide proof of purchase, or vouches to members of staff.
 - Trading with someone with less than 5 vouches will result in no Moderation Support. Unless you would like to request a Moderator Middleman through our #create-ticket-system. Moderators show up on our sidebar, and will generally MM for free or a small fee depending on how big the transaction is, etc.
