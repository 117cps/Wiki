**The Ascension Enclave is the place to be for when Raid Tokens are activated, as that is where the portal for the Raid will spawn. There are no requirements for entrance to the Ascension Enclave. It can be accessed via the '/enclave' or by visiting the portal on the far-right side of the Nexus.**

The layout of the Ascension Enclave is very simple, as it's purpose is only to connect players with Raids. However, if you do want a private location for hitting training dummies, this and the Guild Hall make exceptional choices!
