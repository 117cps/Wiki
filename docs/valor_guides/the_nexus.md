# Loot Boxes

***Valor has various types of lootboxes; do not worry they all except one are obtained by playing. Each of these lootboxes have different item pools and drop locations, but they can all be checked from the same location: the top left of your screen whilst in the nexus or vault. On the Lootboxes Page, you can find Gold, Silver and Bronze Lootboxes, as well as your collected Pack Rat bags. Gold, Silver and Bronze lootboxes drop in the Realm, while Pack Rat bags can be found while doing ascended dungeons.***

***The Marketplace is an incredibly important part of Valor, and acts as the location to buy and sell items for gold. Not all players are allowed to use the Marketplace, as Elite Accounts are not allowed to buy or sell items from other non-elite account players, thus they aren't allowed to use the market. All transactions on the marketplace have an 8% Tax put onto the seller of an item. It also costs 50 gold to remove an item if it isn't your most recently placed item.***

***You can access the Marketplace GUI by talking to the Human NPCs within the marketplace. In this GUI you can sort every item currently on the market, see all the items you have listed on the market, and you can even buy items directly from the GUI instead of waiting for it to be sorted in!***
